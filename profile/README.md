# HardHat Toolbox
HardHat tolbox is a collection of plugins for HardHat C2, which can be found here https://github.com/DragoQCC/HardHatC2.

The main documentation site contains detailed directions on using and creating plugins https://docs.hardhat-c2.net/.

## Tool Types 
**Assets**: A plugin created to support an implant for HardHat C2 should include the main implant code in whatever language is desired and c# plugins to add relevant information to the team server and client. 

**Modules**: A standalone plugin for the team server or client does not need to be directly related to an implant. It can be in c# or can mainly be the desired language with a small c# connector.
